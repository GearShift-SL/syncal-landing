## Acknowledgment

These are the Terms and Conditions governing the use of the Services and the agreement operating between You and the Company. These Terms and Conditions set forth the rights and obligations of all users in relation to the use of the Services.

Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Services.

By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, you may not access the Services.

You represent that you are over the age of 18. The Company does not permit the use of the Services by anyone under the age of 18.

These Terms and Conditions also apply to users who purchase Services in the course of their business.

Your access to and use of the Services are also subject to your acceptance of and compliance with the Company's Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information when you use our Services and informs you of your privacy rights and how you are protected by law. Please read our Privacy Policy carefully before using our Services.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by the Company.

The Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or services.

We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit.

## Limitation of Liability

Without prejudice to any damages you may incur, the total liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of these Terms and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you through the Services or USD 100 if you have not purchased anything through the Services.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, business interruption, personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way connected with the use or inability to use the Services, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Services, or otherwise related to any provision of these Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## Disclaimer “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”

The Services are provided to you “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and their respective licensors and Service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, with respect to the Services, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement, and any warranties that may arise from the course of negotiations, the course of performance, usage, or trade practice. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company makes no warranty or representation that the Services will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards, be error-free, or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the Company's suppliers make any representations or warranties, express or implied, (i) regarding the operation or availability of the Services, or the information, content, materials, or products included therein; (ii) that the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of any information or content provided through the Services; or (iv) that the Services, its servers, the content, or emails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, Trojan horses, worms, malware, time bombs, or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on a consumer's applicable legal rights, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you. But in such a case, the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

## Applicable law

These Terms and your use of the Services shall be governed by Spanish law, excluding conflict of law rules. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

## For users in the European Union (EU)

If you are a consumer in the European Union, you will benefit from the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you reside.

## Dispute Resolution

If you have any questions or disputes about the Services, you agree to first try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us.

## Severability and Waiver

### Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be modified and interpreted to fulfill the objectives of that provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

### Waiver

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.

## Translation Interpretation

These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if we have made them available on Our Services. You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the event of a dispute.

## Changes to these Terms and Conditions

By continuing to access or use Our Services after such revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the website and Services.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Whenever we make a significant change to Our policies, we will also announce it by email to all active users. When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the most recent Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This applies to any of our current and future products and to all features we add to our services over time. There may be times when we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; doing so does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. These terms contain a limitation of our liability.

## Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes

1. If you are using a free version of one of Our Services, we do not ask for your credit card and—as with customers who pay for Our Services—we do not sell your data and never will.

2. For paid Services that offer a free trial, we will explain the duration of the trial when you register. After the trial period, you must pay in advance to continue using the Service. If you do not pay, we will block your account or some of the features of the Service.

3. If you purchase a “lifetime” plan for one of our Services, you will be granted access to those Services without time limitation. This does not include new features or updates to the Service. Although we will do our best to keep the Services running, we reserve the right to modify or discontinue any part of our Services at any time, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice.

4. All prices listed on our website do not include taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect such taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit such taxes to the taxing authorities.

5. All payments are processed by our partner Paddle Payments Limited. When you make a purchase, you agree to share with Paddle the information necessary to process the payment and billing.

## Cancellation and Termination

1. You may cancel your account or downgrade to a free plan (if available) at any time by contacting us or using the corresponding features within the Services.
2. Access to the Services and any content you have posted on the Services will be unavailable from the Services immediately upon cancellation. We reserve the right to permanently delete all content from our systems 60 days after cancellation. If you wish to export any data before your account is canceled, please contact us. Please note that “content” here does not include any data that has been synchronized with third-party services (e.g., your calendar events synchronized with your calendar provider). This data will remain accessible through those third-party services, and you may access it through means other than Our Services.
3. If you cancel the Service before the end of the current billing month, the cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused time in the last billing cycle. Please see Our Refund Policy for more details.

4. We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services by you for any reason at any time. Suspension means that you and any other users of your account will not be able to access the account or any content therein. In addition, suspension will result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, as well as the forfeiture and waiver of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to deny use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. This clause is necessary as a safeguard against abuse of our Services and is normally applied in exceptional circumstances.

## Service and Price Changes

1. Although we make every effort to maintain legacy Services, we reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of Our Services with or without notice. If we can offer an alternative solution, such as a new Company Service that partially or fully replaces the discontinued Services, we will migrate Your account to the new Service.

2. We occasionally modify the pricing structure of Our products. When we do so, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may decide to change prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give you at least 30 days' notice and notify you via your registered email address.

## Uptime, security, and privacy

1. Use of the Services is at the user's own risk. We provide these Services “as is” and “as available.” We do not currently offer service level agreements for Our Services, but we take the uptime of Our applications very seriously.

2. We take many measures to protect and secure your data. We minimize the data we transfer to our server by keeping data processing on the client side whenever possible. When data is transferred and/or collected, we take many measures to protect and secure your data with backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet.

3. When you use our services, you entrust us with some of your data. We take this as a serious responsibility. You agree that the Company may process your data as described in our Privacy Policy and for no other purpose.

4. We use third-party providers and hosting partners to provide the hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology necessary to run the Services. You can find a list of all subprocessors that process personal data in the Privacy Policy.

## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. The names, look, and feel of the Services (including, but not limited to, any images, photographs, animations, videos, and text incorporated into the Services) are copyright© of the Company. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any part of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements without the express written permission of the Company. You must request permission to use the Company logo or any logo of the Services for promotional purposes.

2. You agree not to decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, modify, reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, or exploit any part of the Services, the use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission of the Company.

3. You agree to assign to the Company all rights to any comments, feature requests, or suggestions you share with us through our Community board, email, or any other communication channel. This means that the Company may use your suggestions to develop, market, promote, and/or patent new features, claiming exclusive ownership.

## Features and bugs

1. We design Our Services with care, based on Our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no service that satisfies everyone. We do not guarantee that our services will meet your specific needs or expectations. If you are dissatisfied with any of our services, please let us know. If you have already purchased a paid plan, please refer to Our Refund Policy.

2. We also thoroughly test all of our features before releasing them. As with any software, our services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs that are reported to us and work on the most important ones, especially those related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs are fixed, so we do not guarantee completely bug-free services.
